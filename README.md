# DON´T BE A CITIZEN

# decisionMaker v0.1-proposal
This will become a proposal to put into code a system that can make decisions on a global scale fairly and will ultimately replace nation-based government.
It´s probably doomed, but I´ll keep hacking at it until I´m certain about that..
It might be a bit megalomanic, but hey.. 
I have done things before because I didn´t know they were impossible to do, so who knows.
I have very little interest in politics, creeds or beliefs, but a lot of interest in fairness and I´m sick of the way we run things now.


## the why
### no more governments..
It is time to understand, it´s not Chinese government that is the problemn, not US government, not UK government, not Ugandan government. It´s ANY government. 
Governments will always tend to overreach, lie, cheat, play dirty. 
You think we are bad, we think you are bad, because that´s all we hear. 
Propaganda. 

### but we need something... No revolution, evolution.
But we NEED some kind of standard, some kind of government. But we can´t get there by fighting..
In stead.. we can just restructure them, from within the different systems we have, so that they are more transparent and make it impossible for them to be so grabby of our information and lives and efforts. 

We try to do this now by voting or rebellion, but I think neither way is working. Problem is, people who want power are attracted to government positions, we need to think differently. Make it so that you HAVE to be smart to get into government, pass a test, because smart and empathy and a sense of duty to the human race go together. 

Right now, it´s only insane systems, which boil down to
1. popularity contests 
2. who has the biggest stick

Neither has anything to do with the capability and sensibility to lead and think about the needs of people.

Democracy is broken, as broken as dictatorships or just monarchies, warlords and feodal systems, whatever you think you belong to, you have to know you are being lied to... 
We will not get it right spontaneously, we need to structure this carefully,  starting with some things we can all agree on: 

## the what:
- Freedom of speech. Anyone should be allowed to say anything. It´s the only way, because we cannot say before hand what is hate, what is stupidity. Communication is ALWAYS a good thing. But you cannot group together to DO nasty things.
This gives a free press AND a lot of noise. We should attempt to limit propaganda, marketing and lies by educating people about their psychological vulnerabilities. Show people how they can be influenced. 

- We need good education, FREE. It should NOT be a must. It should be something you WANT to do. It´s already happening, you learn by watching video´s, you look on wikipedia. But we need to give this structure.  Schools in the west now are mostly a place to put citizens we cannot trust yet. They are basically prisons with a program to better the inmates. 
Education should be free of indoctrination as much as possible. We should educate people on how to judge and obtain information for themselves and instruct them on how to use their brain. That´s it. No opinions. You can spread opinions, but NOT in the context of education. Information labeled education must be free of bias.

- Freedom of self-expression. if it doesn´t bother somebody else, it´s not a problem. What you do, who you do it with and how you do it is your business as long as you do not restrict others in their pursuit of happiness (this can always be debated).
We all want others to behave, so that we can do what we want and if we think for two seconds, we can understand that can only work if we let them do what they want. 

- If we have children, our children should be safe and get a chance to be happy. 
 They shouldn´t be spoiled or entitled, nobody should be. 
  We shouldn´t be allowed to breed indefinitely, there should be some limitation. Children should have some say in government

- We should agree there is something called property. 
(Also intellectual property, but that will have to be treated differently. Copying is not theft) 
 We need a good way to protect our stuff and money, but we shouldn´t be allowed to hoard it beyond a certain point. 
 This is an instant reward system, but the free market is TOO free. Also, if you work together with someone to do something, there  must be a limit to how much you can take of the proceedings. 
 
- We need to take care of the environment and not poison it beyond repair, but we need to be able to grow our industries.. 

- We all want food on the table and we need to be responsible with other living things. 

- We all want a future and less worries and pressure in the now, no stress.. but not leisure.. We all want a feeling of belonging and doing good. We want a job that makes sense. We want to learn, play, develop ourselves. There must be flow, to produce happiness, which includes some meaningfull challenges.

- We all want to die with dignity and not violently.  So there must be consequences for those things, but it doesn´t have to be more violence and death..

This is a list of things we should agree on, if we are to have a chance.
If you have or foresee a problem with one of the things above, please make an issue.

OK.. When we know what we want.. 
We know what fair IS, we just will not always see it (this is how our brain works). 
Sometimes we are a bit blind, but in the long run, we get it..

## the how
We will open source the whole law system and quit the whole nation-business! 
We willl attempt to get these basic values iron-clad down on paper. 
Make grey area´s and hard edges that are clear on both sides of every issue. And then go into specifics. 
We will do this HERE..

### the software
We can make a software system online that makes most fair regulations float to the top by simply voting and discussing online. 
We could work with tests that determin how well somebody understands himself AND all sides of an issue, before they can weigh in. ANYONE should be allowed to weigh in, prisoners, homeless, children, CEO´s.. regardless of nationality, age, gender, race, health, philosophy, religion or standpoint... 
It doesn´t matter, as long as they understand, what the issues are, they should get a say. 
#### weighed voting
The weight of your voice is determined by how well you did in the test.

#### issue voting in stead of person voting
Who makes the test? We all do... Who decides what is a right answer? We all do. Asnwers will be rated anonymously. We will not know WHO said it, only if we agree with them. And we will see the score he or she got on the test. That is ALL the relevant information. 
I call this system: DecisionMaker v0.1, now let´s improve on it. Shoot holes..

## the license and ownership
It should be open source and free, anybody can join in..If any aliens drop by or dolphins turn out to be really intelligent in this way, they should fit right in.
And if by some chance, you don´t agree, you can use this to make your own fairer system.

### The executive side of governing and regulating 
And then we create a standing army and police force, by donations only. We vow to never attack, but only defend our values if they are under clear attack. We will set up a system to judge if this is so in the same way we did for other issues. 
If we don´t do a good job, donatinons stop (no tax) and somebody else get´s a chance. 
We don´t need a nation or land, we can be anywhere and we will take care of all (not just our own group)..

## What we need to do first:
But this will only work if you are wiling to pay or do your bit for a good government.. (Not one that will tax you, because you were born on it´s grounds, but one you choose once you are over 14)
No nations, a global task force, with local cells. And we wont stop at law, we go to other policies, like building infrastructure and technology and health insurance. 

# No more THEM
I am sure we can do it, if we can do ONE thing..
We need to agree and see what the real problem is: 
how government is organised that we have a thing like nations now and stop thinking in us and them. It´s all us. There is no them. And we ALL need to get along or we are ALL in danger.
Anything else is madness prolonged..

Now please contribute something..
