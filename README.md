# DON´T BE A CITIZEN

# decisionMaker v0.1-proposal
This will become a proposal to put into code a system that can make decisions on a global scale fairly and will ultimately replace nation-based government.

I am a developer, this will appeal most to developers.
The idea comes from sites/software like https://stackoverflow.com/ and https://meta.stackexchange.com, where incredibly complicated matter is being explained daily to masses of people. From https://nl.khanacademy.org/ which aims to spread education around the globe, to give anyone a fair chance. And from https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf the bitcoin manifesto, which utilises systems like blockchain or tangle, which is basically a collaborative security system.
The right information floats to the top, because of a system of feedback loops they have. 
This lead me to think about how we could do the same for subtler systems.
Hopefully eleminating war, greed, nations and hate. (basically us and them thinking)

This project is probably doomed, because it´s scope is too big.
But I´ll keep hacking at it until I´m absolutely certain about that, I hope some people will join me, but if not.. 
I´ll keep coming back here and adding.
``` 
If(want_to_change-the_world===true  &&  have_sourcecode===false)
{
    write_it_from_the_ground_up();
}
```

It might be a bit megalomanic to even start this, but hey.. 
People have done things before because they didn´t know they were impossible to do, so who knows...

## the why
### no more governments..
We can all bitch about Trump, say China is a dictatorship.. Generally don´t agree with our own governments.
But....
It is time to understand, it´s not Chinese government that is the problemn, not the US government, not the UK government, not Ugandan government. 

> It´s ANY government. 

Governments will always tend to overreach, lie, cheat, play dirty. 
You think we are bad, we think you are bad, because that´s all we hear. 
Propaganda. 

### but we need something... No revolution, evolution.
We NEED some kind of NEW standard, some kind of NEW government, a NEW way to regulate ourselves, that is fair but also takes into account that we are human.. We cannot trust ourselves... 
And we can´t get there by fighting..
Instead.. we can just restructure the governments we have, from within the different systems we have, so that they are more transparent and make it impossible for them to be so grabby of our information and lives and efforts.
They will have to join US. And with us, I mean everybody.

We might be trying to do this now by voting or even rebellion, but I think neither way is working or has EVER WORKED IN THE PAST.
Democracy is 2000 years old. And it´s broken. Even the greek philosophers could see that and tried to enstate an olygarchy.

You see, the basic problem is, people who want power, are emotionally constipated people, and THEY are attracted to government positions, we need to think differently. We need to recognise this common problem.
Make it so that you HAVE to be smart and realistic about your own shortcomings to get into government, pass a test, because smart and empathy and a sense of duty to the human race go together. 

Right now, it´s only insane systems, which boil down to:
1. popularity contests (democracy)
2. who has the biggest stick (military based systems)
3. who is your daddy (inherited kingships)
4. Who has the closest connection to our imaginary friend (Yes, the pope leads a NATION!)

None of these has anything to do with the capability and sensibility to lead and think about the needs of people.
And these are ALL the systems we came up with the passed 2000 years.
No wonder some people are nihilists and only want anarchy.

Democracy is broken, as broken as dictatorships or just monarchies, warlords and feodal systems, whatever you think you belong to, you have to know you are being lied to...? 
We will not get it right spontaneously, we need to structure this carefully, we have the technology to do this fairly.
And I think we can start with some things we can all agree on: 

## the what:
- **Freedom of speech**. Anyone should be allowed to say anything. It´s the only way, because we cannot say before hand what is hate, what is stupidity. Communication is ALWAYS a good thing. But you cannot group together to DO nasty things.
This gives a free press AND a lot of noise. We should attempt to limit propaganda, marketing and lies by educating people about their psychological vulnerabilities. Show people how they can be influenced. 

- We need **good, clean education**, FREE. It should NOT be an obligation. It should be something you WANT to do, a privilege, not something you do in a prison.. This change´s already happening, you learn by watching video´s, you look on wikipedia. But we need to give this more structure. Schools (around my place) now are mostly a place to put citizens we cannot trust yet. They are basically prisons with a program to better the inmates.
Education should be free of indoctrination as much as possible. We should educate people on how to judge and obtain information for themselves and instruct them on how to use their brain. That´s it. No opinions. You can spread opinions, but NOT in the context of education. Information labeled education must be free of bias.

- **Freedom of self-expression**. if it doesn´t bother somebody else, it´s not a problem. What you do, who you do it with and how you do it is your business as long as you do not restrict others in their pursuit of happiness (this can always be debated).
We all want others to behave, so that we can do what we want and if we think for two seconds, we can understand that can only work if we let them do what they want. 

- If we have **children**, our children should be safe and get a chance to be happy. 
 They shouldn´t be spoiled or entitled, nobody should be. 
  We shouldn´t be allowed to breed indefinitely, there should be some limitation. Children should have some say in government

- **Elderly** should be taken care of as much as possible. But we cannot do it the way we used to, because of the enormous generation and the lack of younger people to take care of them. Here we need a boost from technology.. Robots.. And the elderly have the money to make this happen and pave the way for future generations. We need to invest in non-human-care if we want our elderly to have ANY quality of life. It´s just Math. There is going to be two elderly persons for each able bodied 50 something very soon.

- We should agree there is something called **property**.
There are cultures (in Ethiopia among others) that thrive without this concept, but most people on earth are used to it. We shouldn´t see it as a god-given right, though.. You can have what you can keep and we will try to help you keep it.
(Also intellectual property, but that will have to be treated differently. Copying is not theft. Information cannot be monetized in the long run, without holding up development) 
We need a good way to protect our stuff and money, but we shouldn´t be allowed to hoard it beyond a certain point. 
 This is an instant reward system, but the free market is TOO free. Also, if you work together with someone to do something, there  must be a limit to how much you can take of the proceedings. 
 
- We need to take care of the **environment** and not poison it beyond repair, but we need to be able to grow our industries and technology.. Also we should assess these situations calmly, fear is not a good advisor. It seems to me, the way forward is clear, but there is a lot of heated discussion over this. So I´m probably not the person to say how this should be taken care of. But it´s important. 

- We all want **food** on the table and we need to be responsible with other living things. But living is consuming something else that is alive. This is true for plants, spores, germs, virusses and animals (like humans). We cannot deny our nature, but we can be responsible with this.

- **Stress** We all want a steady future and less worries and pressure in the now, no stress.. but also not leisure.. We all want a feeling of belonging and doing good. We want a job that makes sense. We want to learn, play, develop ourselves. There must be flow, to produce happiness, which includes some meaningfull challenges. Trust me, I´m a game designer/developer.

- We all want to die with **dignity** and not violently. So there must be consequences for those things, but it doesn´t have to be more violence and death.. Also there is heated discussion about pro-life/pro-choice. This is nonsense. A foetus cannot speak or think, neither can a dolphin. Unless you are a vegan, you cannot be pro-life, you must be pro-choice. AND there must be a line else we get POST-natal abortion and then I think everybody agrees it´s murder.
So we have eshtablished we are prostitutes, now we are just haggling about the price, like the joke goes..
We can not base our way of thinking or living on texts written thousands of years ago or on something we believe. 
Sorry, we just can´t. But we don´t need to discard it either. We can take in lessons learned, we can adapt, emulate, but it´s not dogma. We need to think, challenge. Learn to distinguish information from opinion.

This is a list of things we should agree on, if we are to have a chance to be fair to all in my opinion. 
I will not participate in something that does not include this, but you are free to make your own version. 
I don´t really care about details, yet, as long as we can remain reasonable, working them out. 
There will be limits to all these points. Grey area´s. We will find them and deal with them. It can´t be perfect..
But these are the basics, the thing we look back to..

If you have or foresee a problem with one of the things above, please make an issue and state your bug..

OK.. When we know what we want.. (hoping we even get so far)

We know what fair IS, we just will not always see it (this is how our brain works). 
Sometimes we are a bit blind, but in the long run, we get it..
All we need now, is a little help, a plan, a HOW..

## The how
We will open source the whole law system and quit the whole nation-business! 
We willl attempt to get these basic values iron-clad down on paper. 
Make grey area´s and hard edges that are clear on both sides of every issue. And then go into specifics. 
We will do this HERE..

### The software
We can make a software system online that makes most fair regulations float to the top by simply voting and discussing online. 
We could work with tests that determin how well somebody understands himself AND all sides of an issue, before they can weigh in. ANYONE should be allowed to weigh in, prisoners, homeless, children, CEO´s.. regardless of nationality, age, gender, race, health, philosophy, religion or standpoint... 
It doesn´t matter, as long as they understand, what the issues are, they should get a say. 

#### Unique voting and security
We need a way to uniquely identify persons and register their vote in a way that cannot be falsified. This means technologies like blockchain or tangle for an open register that can be viewed by all, but not altered by anyone, once a transaction. 

#### Weighed voting
The weight of your voice is determined by how well you did in the test of consisting of two parts: How well do you know yourself, how well do you know the issue. This MUST be tested, people have a higher opinion of themselves than is readonable. Not just some, but ALL people.

#### Issue voting in stead of person voting
Who makes the test? Won´t they be in charge? Nope.. We all do... 
Who decides what is a right answer in these two tests? We all do. 
Asnwers will be rated anonymously. 
We will not know WHO said it, only if we agree with them. And we will see the score he or she got on the test. 
That is ALL the relevant information. 
I call this system: DecisionMaker v0.1, now let´s improve on it. Shoot some holes..

## the license and ownership
It should be open source and free, anybody can join in..If any aliens drop by or dolphins turn out to be really intelligent in this way, they should fit right in.
And if by some chance, you don´t agree, you can use this to make your own fairer system.

### The executive side of governing and regulating 
And then we create a standing army and police force, by donations only. We vow to never attack, but only defend our values if they are under clear attack. We will set up a system to judge if this is so in the same way we did for other issues. 
If we don´t do a good job, donatinons stop (no tax) and somebody else get´s a chance. 
We don´t need a nation or land, we can be anywhere and we will take care of all (not just our own group)..

## What we need to do first:
But this will only work if you are wiling to pay or do your bit for a good government.. (Not one that will tax you, because you were born on it´s grounds, but one you choose once you are over 14)
No nations, a global task force, with local cells. And we wont stop at law, we go to other policies, like building infrastructure and technology and health insurance. 

# No more THEM
I am sure we can do it, if we can do ONE thing..
We need to agree and see what the real problem is: 
how government is organised that we have a thing like nations now and stop thinking in us and them. It´s all us. There is no them. And we ALL need to get along or we are ALL in danger.
Anything else is madness prolonged..

Now please contribute something..
